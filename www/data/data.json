I started as a Lean Coach, shifted into Kanban and visualisation of flow (Presented a talk on Visualisation and Coaching as a way to create change at the Lean Summit 2016). \nI am a Servant Leadership facilitator for Standard Bank’s internal Agile Leadership Programme targeted at all 2000 IT employees (this has gone viral an is now spreading out across the bank as a whole) and am currently focused on embedding and strengthening this way of thinking and leading in one of the Core IT Transformation Programmes (200 people who have a strong Agile/ Scrum base).\n\nI am also an Ontological Transformation Coach and hold the Guinness World Record for the Deepest Dive by a Woman on Scuba. These last two are important pillars for my focus on changing mindsets and behaviours as I have lived through the impact of being embedded in unilateral control thinking - it was stopping me from seeing a way forward in my diving. It was only when I chose a new way of showing up that I was able to find my way forward and reach 221 meters and the Woman’s World Record.\n</p>",

              "description": "<p>This session is targeted at Coaches & Scrum Masters who are struggling with getting people to think Agile and so behave in a more Agile manner.  In particular, how do you get managers at all levels to shift out of the old waterfall way of thinking and behaving and really adopt Agile ? How do you get feature teams to be autonomous and self-managing? \nWe know we need to address the behaviour and cultures that are thwarting Agility, but are stuck on the ‘how ? ’ As individuals in the thick of it, it is easy to coach only at a process level in the hope that by focusing people on ‘doing’ Agile they will start to ‘think’ Agile. In so doing, we often actively avoid focusing on the people and how they are engaging with Agile, believing that this is a specialized field outside of our scope and limited to people like therapists & professional coaches. This often results in a high demand and dependence on Agile coaches to ensure people stick to the processes and principles. \nAt its core, Agile is a shift away from unilateral control. Only unilateral control is a way of being that is deeply embedded within us (leaders and followers alike) and so hard to shift without a conscious intervention.\nWithin Standard Bank we have been implementing a Behaviour Laboratory run internally by IT resources that focuses on a new style of leadership - the mutual learning model. Introduced by Roger Schwartz in his book  “The Skilled Facilitator”, mutual learning and its ground rules for collaboration create strong support for Agile and SAFE implementation at an individual level and in so doing, allows us to create and actively support an environment and behaviours that sustain  the agile culture shift. \n</p>",
